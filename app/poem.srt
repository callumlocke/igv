00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
“To the Top”

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Over one mountain after another surrounded by higher ones still.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
After you overcome one mountain there is always one more.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Forced to renew my strength again and again I have to press on with the walk.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Sometimes it is so tiring that I want to give up on everything and just stop.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
However, once it has started the road will lead me to the end one day.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Don't give up now, don't give in.

8
00:00:20,5 00 --> 00:00:23,000
Try to release all the exhaustion by the lake, enjoying nature

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and listening to the birds sing.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Renew your strength my beloved man.
