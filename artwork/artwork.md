# Artwork

Put you artwork in this folder so that it's committed to the repository.

This folder is for working sources files that have NOT been preapred for web:

* Firerworks PNGs (uncompressed working image files - not for web use)
* Photoshop PSD or Illustrator AI files - both designs and sources files used in someway in the graphic.
* SVG - usually these should be in the /app/images folder but sometimes larger sources SVGs should go here.
* Original video files before they are preparsed for web.

Also designs:

* screenshot mockups
* Balsamiq mockups
* scans of pencil drawings
* etc
